This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project done on Football data. The data is obtained from understat.com and the owner of the dataset is Sergi Lehkyi.
The dataset contains statistical summary data by the end of each season from 2014 till 2019 for 6 UEFA Leagues.

The aim of this project is to study the metrics used in this dataset, perform feature engineering and data manipulation. Thereby analyze the performance of top teams in Europe over the years and also look at the performance of Barcelona FC closely.

Correlations within features of the dataset are looked at for each league and by implementing Hypothesis Testing certain conclusions can be drawn.
